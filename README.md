# Eat-Da-Burger
Node-mySQL-Express-Handlebars Burger App

Easy to use Heroku-hosted App that allows users to write in the names of burgers and make them with the "make Burger" button, then click on the button next to any burger in the left-hand column of the screen to "eat" that burger. All eaten burgers appear on the right-hand column.

This app uses Node JS, Express, Express-Handlebars, Path JS, mySQL, and a self-made ORM to handle mySQL-to-JS data parsing
